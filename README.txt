This is Acme Work-Plans, our D02 project in Design & Testing II. We are implementing several functionalities like Shouting and Task Management.

As requested in the course, the publication has been made in CleverCloud. Both us and many other students have had many problems, starting with typos in the slides where the steps to follow were explained to failures of CleverCloud itself that does not show views that in the project work without any problems.

We think that some of these problems may be due to using /manager/ as address, since TomCat servers use that range as reserved address. In the code requested in the requirements everything works without any problem.
